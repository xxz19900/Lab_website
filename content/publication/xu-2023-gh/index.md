abstract: 'Purpose: Fungal keratitis (FK) is a serious corneal infection with high
  morbidity. Host immune responses function as a double-edged sword by eradicating
  fungal pathogens while also causing corneal damage, dictating the severity, progression,
  and outcome of FK. However, the underlying immunopathogenesis remains elusive. Methods:
  Time-course transcriptome was performed to illustrate the dynamic immune landscape
  in a mouse model of FK. Integrated bioinformatic analyses included identification
  of differentially expressed genes, time series clustering, Gene Ontology enrichment,
  and inference of infiltrating immune cells. Gene expression was verified by quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blot, or immunohistochemistry. Results:
  FK mice exhibited dynamic immune responses with concerted trends with clinical score,
  transcriptional alteration, and immune cell infiltration score peaking at 3 days
  post infection (dpi). Disrupted substrate metabolism, broad immune activation, and
  corneal wound healing occurred sequentially in early, middle, and late stages of
  FK. Meanwhile, dynamics of infiltrating innate and adaptive immune cells displayed
  distinct characteristics. Proportions of dendritic cells showed overall decreasing
  trend with fungal infection, whereas that of macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils
  rose sharply in early stage and then gradually decreased as inflammation resolved.
  Activation of adaptive immune cells was also observed in late stage of infection.
  Furthermore, shared immune responses and activation of AIM2-, pyrin-, and ZBP1-mediated
  PANoptosis were revealed across different time points. Conclusions: Our study profiles
  the dynamic immune landscape and highlights the crucial roles of PANoptosis in FK
  pathogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into host responses to fungi
  and contribute to the development of PANoptosis-targeted therapeutics for patients
  with FK.'
