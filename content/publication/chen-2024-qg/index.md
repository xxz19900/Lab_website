abstract: 'PURPOSE: To examine whether corneal epithelial dendritic cells (CEDC) could
  serve as an indicator to distinguish obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)
  with or without ocular surface inflammation (OSI). METHODS: We performed a case-control
  study on patients with diagnosed obstructive MGD between August 2017 and November
  2019. RESULTS: 30 MGD cases and 25 healthy controls were recruited. The classification
  of MGD patients with and without OSI was based on the tear pro-inflammatory cytokine
  levels. Compared with the MGD without OSI and the control group, a higher CEDC density
  was detected in the MGD with OSI subgroup. The presence of >15.6 cells/mm2 CEDC
  had a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 75% for the diagnosis of MGD with OSI.
  CONCLUSIONS: OSI is not present in all patients with obstructive MGD. Evaluation
  of CEDC density in the central cornea may help identify whether MGD is concomitant
  with OSI.'
