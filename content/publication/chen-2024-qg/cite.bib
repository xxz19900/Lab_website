 abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine whether corneal epithelial dendritic cells
(CEDC) could serve as an indicator to distinguish obstructive
meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) with or without ocular surface
inflammation (OSI). METHODS: We performed a case-control study on
patients with diagnosed obstructive MGD between August 2017 and
November 2019. RESULTS: 30 MGD cases and 25 healthy controls were
recruited. The classification of MGD patients with and without
OSI was based on the tear pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.
Compared with the MGD without OSI and the control group, a higher
CEDC density was detected in the MGD with OSI subgroup. The
presence of >15.6 cells/mm2 CEDC had a sensitivity of 73% and
specificity of 75% for the diagnosis of MGD with OSI.
CONCLUSIONS: OSI is not present in all patients with obstructive
MGD. Evaluation of CEDC density in the central cornea may help
identify whether MGD is concomitant with OSI.},
