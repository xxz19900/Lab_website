abstract: Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare parasitic infection of the cornea that
  can lead to permanent blindness if not diagnosed and treated promptly. We collected
  data on the incidences of Acanthamoeba keratitis from 20 countries and calculated
  an annual incidence of 23,561 cases, with the lowest rates in Tunisia and Belgium,
  and the highest in India. We analyzed 3755 Acanthamoeba sequences from the GenBank
  database across Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania and genotyped
  them into T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T10, T11, T12, and T15. Many genotypes possess different
  characteristics, yet T4 is the most prevalent genotype. As efficient treatment against
  Acanthamoeba remains lacking, prevention from early diagnosis via staining, PCR,
  or in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) becomes significant for the condition's prognosis.
  IVCM is the most recommended approach for the early detection of Acanthamoeba. If
  IVCM is unavailable, PCR should be used as an alternative.
