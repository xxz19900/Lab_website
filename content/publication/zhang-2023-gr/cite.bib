 abstract = {Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare parasitic infection of the
cornea that can lead to permanent blindness if not diagnosed and
treated promptly. We collected data on the incidences of
Acanthamoeba keratitis from 20 countries and calculated an
annual incidence of 23,561 cases, with the lowest rates in
Tunisia and Belgium, and the highest in India. We analyzed 3755
Acanthamoeba sequences from the GenBank database across Asia,
Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania and genotyped
them into T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T10, T11, T12, and T15. Many
genotypes possess different characteristics, yet T4 is the most
prevalent genotype. As efficient treatment against Acanthamoeba
remains lacking, prevention from early diagnosis via staining,
PCR, or in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) becomes significant
for the condition's prognosis. IVCM is the most recommended
approach for the early detection of Acanthamoeba. If IVCM is
unavailable, PCR should be used as an alternative.},
