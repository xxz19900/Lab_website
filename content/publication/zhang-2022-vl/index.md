abstract: Bacterial keratitis (BK) is the most common type of infectious keratitis.
  The spectrum of pathogenic bacteria and their susceptibility to antibiotics varied
  with the different regions. A meta-analysis was conducted to review the global culture
  rate, distribution, current trends, and drug susceptibility of isolates from BK
  over the past 20 years (2000-2020). Four databases were searched, and published
  date was limited between 2000 and 2020. Main key words were ``bacterial keratitis'',
  ``culture results'' and ``drug resistance''. Forty-two studies from twenty-one countries
  (35 cities) were included for meta-analysis. The overall positive culture rate was
  47% (95%CI, 42-52%). Gram-positive cocci were the major type of bacteria (62%),
  followed by Gram-negative bacilli (30%), Gram-positive bacilli (5%), and Gram-negative
  cocci (5%). Staphylococcus spp. (41.4%), Pseudomonas spp. (17.0%), Streptococcus
  spp. (13.1%), Corynebacterium spp. (6.6%) and Moraxella spp. (4.1%) were the most
  common bacterial organism. The antibiotic resistance pattern analysis revealed that
  most Gram-positive cocci were susceptive to aminoglycoside (86%), followed by fluoroquinolone
  (81%) and cephalosporin (79%). Gram-negative bacilli were most sensitive to cephalosporin
  (96%) and fluoroquinolones (96%), followed by aminoglycoside (92%). In Gram-positive
  cocci, the susceptibility trends of fluoroquinolones were decreasing since 2010.
  Clinics should pay attention to the changing trends of pathogen distribution and
  their drug resistance pattern and should diagnose and choose sensitive antibiotics
  based on local data.
