 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To summarize the clinical manifestations,
microbiological profile, treatment, and prognosis of corneal
infections after different keratorefractive surgery. METHODS: To
obtain relevant studies, English-language databases, including
PubMed, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, and CLNAHL, were searched
from January 1979 to March 2022. The fundamentals of the
literature, clinical characteristics, pathogens, and treatments
were retrieved for each included article. RESULTS: Eighty-four
studies involving 306 infectious eyes were included in this
review. Risk factors of potential infection included a history of
blepharitis, contact lens usage, and contaminated surgical
instruments. The mean onset time was 22.9$Â±$38.7 days (range: 1
day to 3 years). The most common organism isolated from
infectious keratitis after keratorefractive surgery were
Staphylococcus aureus , followed by Mycobacterium and
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus . Most of the infections after
refractive procedures were sensitive to medical treatment alone,
and the ultimate best-corrected visual acuity after medical
treatment was as follows: 20/20 or better in 82 cases (37.0%),
20/40 or better in 170 cases (76.5%), and worse than 20/40 in 52
cases (23.5%). Surgical interventions including flap lift, flap
amputation, ring removal, and keratoplasty were performed in 120
eyes (44.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Most infections after
keratorefractive surgery occur within a week, whereas more than
half of the cases after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis
happen after about a month. Gram-positive cocci and mycobacterium
are the most common isolates. Infections after LASIK,
intracorneal ring (ICR) implantation, and small incision
lenticule extraction, which primarily occur between the cornea
layers, require irrigation of the tunnels or pocket with
antibiotics.},
