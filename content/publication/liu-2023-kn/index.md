abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To summarize the clinical manifestations, microbiological profile,
  treatment, and prognosis of corneal infections after different keratorefractive
  surgery. METHODS: To obtain relevant studies, English-language databases, including
  PubMed, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, and CLNAHL, were searched from January 1979
  to March 2022. The fundamentals of the literature, clinical characteristics, pathogens,
  and treatments were retrieved for each included article. RESULTS: Eighty-four studies
  involving 306 infectious eyes were included in this review. Risk factors of potential
  infection included a history of blepharitis, contact lens usage, and contaminated
  surgical instruments. The mean onset time was 22.9$Â±$38.7 days (range: 1 day to
  3 years). The most common organism isolated from infectious keratitis after keratorefractive
  surgery were Staphylococcus aureus , followed by Mycobacterium and coagulase-negative
  Staphylococcus . Most of the infections after refractive procedures were sensitive
  to medical treatment alone, and the ultimate best-corrected visual acuity after
  medical treatment was as follows: 20/20 or better in 82 cases (37.0%), 20/40 or
  better in 170 cases (76.5%), and worse than 20/40 in 52 cases (23.5%). Surgical
  interventions including flap lift, flap amputation, ring removal, and keratoplasty
  were performed in 120 eyes (44.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Most infections after keratorefractive
  surgery occur within a week, whereas more than half of the cases after laser-assisted
  in situ keratomileusis happen after about a month. Gram-positive cocci and mycobacterium
  are the most common isolates. Infections after LASIK, intracorneal ring (ICR) implantation,
  and small incision lenticule extraction, which primarily occur between the cornea
  layers, require irrigation of the tunnels or pocket with antibiotics.'
