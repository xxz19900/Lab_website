abstract: 'BACKGROUND: High genetic variability at the reverse transcriptase (RT)
  region of HBV could confer resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NUCs).
  The aim of this study was to identify new RT amino acid (AA) substitutions related
  to NUC resistance. METHODS: HBV RT sequences of genotype C from 501 chronic hepatitis
  B (CHB) patients were analysed to identify potential RT substitutions related to
  NUC resistance. In vitro studies without and with NUCs were performed in a HepG2
  cell line transfected by clones with RT harbouring wild-type or substituted AA(s)
  of interest. RESULTS: Among 261 NUC-treated CHB patients, we found a high detection
  rate of rtM204I/V substitution (30.7% [80/261]). We identified a new substitution
  of rtH55R, and its detection rate had a significantly increasing trend from 3.8%
  (9/240) in the untreated group to 7.2% (13/181) or 33.8% (27/80) in the treated
  group with rtM204 or with rtM204I/V substitutions (P<0.0001). In vitro studies showed
  that rtH55R had a similar HBV DNA level compared to wild type. The rtH55R+rtM204I
  clone had a significantly better replication capacity than the rtM204I clone without
  NUCs (P<0.05). The replication capacity of the rtM204I clone was found to significantly
  decrease under lamivudine treatment, but this was not found in the rtH55R+rtM204I
  clone. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a new HBV RT substitution of rtH55R in genotype-C-infected
  CHB patients. It is frequently found in combination with rtM204I/V substitution
  under NUC treatment. In vitro studies suggest that it might play some replication
  compensatory role in rtM204I mutants under lamivudine treatment.'
