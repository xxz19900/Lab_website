 abstract = {BACKGROUND: High genetic variability at the reverse transcriptase
(RT) region of HBV could confer resistance to
nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NUCs). The aim of this study was
to identify new RT amino acid (AA) substitutions related to NUC
resistance. METHODS: HBV RT sequences of genotype C from 501
chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients were analysed to identify
potential RT substitutions related to NUC resistance. In vitro
studies without and with NUCs were performed in a HepG2 cell line
transfected by clones with RT harbouring wild-type or substituted
AA(s) of interest. RESULTS: Among 261 NUC-treated CHB patients,
we found a high detection rate of rtM204I/V substitution (30.7%
[80/261]). We identified a new substitution of rtH55R, and its
detection rate had a significantly increasing trend from 3.8%
(9/240) in the untreated group to 7.2% (13/181) or 33.8%
(27/80) in the treated group with rtM204 or with rtM204I/V
substitutions (P<0.0001). In vitro studies showed that rtH55R had
a similar HBV DNA level compared to wild type. The rtH55R+rtM204I
clone had a significantly better replication capacity than the
rtM204I clone without NUCs (P<0.05). The replication capacity of
the rtM204I clone was found to significantly decrease under
lamivudine treatment, but this was not found in the
rtH55R+rtM204I clone. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a new HBV RT
substitution of rtH55R in genotype-C-infected CHB patients. It is
frequently found in combination with rtM204I/V substitution under
NUC treatment. In vitro studies suggest that it might play some
replication compensatory role in rtM204I mutants under lamivudine
treatment.},
