 abstract = {Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GQD), a traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM) formula, has long been used for the treatment of common
metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. However,
the main limitation of its wider application is ingredient
complexity of this formula. Thus, it is critically important to
identify the major active ingredients of GQD and to illustrate
mechanisms underlying its action. Here, we compared the effects
of GQD and berberine, a hypothetical key active pharmaceutical
ingredient of GQD, on a diabetic rat model by comprehensive
analyses of gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids,
proinflammatory cytokines, and ileum transcriptomics. Our
results show that berberine and GQD had similar effects on
lowering blood glucose levels, modulating gut microbiota,
inducing ileal gene expression, as well as relieving systemic
and local inflammation. As expected, both berberine and GQD
treatment significantly altered the overall gut microbiota
structure and enriched many butyrate-producing bacteria,
including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, thereby attenuating
intestinal inflammation and lowering glucose. Levels of
short-chain fatty acids in rat feces were also significantly
elevated after treatment with berberine or GQD. Moreover,
concentration of serum proinflammatory cytokines and expression
of immune-related genes, including Nfkb1, Stat1, and Ifnrg1, in
pancreatic islets were significantly reduced after treatment.
Our study demonstrates that the main effects of GQD can be
attributed to berberine via modulating gut microbiota. The
strategy employed would facilitate further standardization and
widespread application of TCM in many diseases.},
