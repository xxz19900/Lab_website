abstract: Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GQD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula,
  has long been used for the treatment of common metabolic diseases, including type
  2 diabetes mellitus. However, the main limitation of its wider application is ingredient
  complexity of this formula. Thus, it is critically important to identify the major
  active ingredients of GQD and to illustrate mechanisms underlying its action. Here,
  we compared the effects of GQD and berberine, a hypothetical key active pharmaceutical
  ingredient of GQD, on a diabetic rat model by comprehensive analyses of gut microbiota,
  short-chain fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, and ileum transcriptomics. Our
  results show that berberine and GQD had similar effects on lowering blood glucose
  levels, modulating gut microbiota, inducing ileal gene expression, as well as relieving
  systemic and local inflammation. As expected, both berberine and GQD treatment significantly
  altered the overall gut microbiota structure and enriched many butyrate-producing
  bacteria, including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, thereby attenuating intestinal
  inflammation and lowering glucose. Levels of short-chain fatty acids in rat feces
  were also significantly elevated after treatment with berberine or GQD. Moreover,
  concentration of serum proinflammatory cytokines and expression of immune-related
  genes, including Nfkb1, Stat1, and Ifnrg1, in pancreatic islets were significantly
  reduced after treatment. Our study demonstrates that the main effects of GQD can
  be attributed to berberine via modulating gut microbiota. The strategy employed
  would facilitate further standardization and widespread application of TCM in many
  diseases.
