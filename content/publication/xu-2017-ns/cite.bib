 abstract = {Naturally occurring nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance (NUCr)
substitution frequencies in the reverse transcriptase (RT) of the
hepatitis B virus (HBV) were studied extensively after the
clinical approval of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs; year of
approval 1998). We aimed to study NUCr substitutions in HBV RT
sequences obtained before 1998 and better understand the
evolution of RT sequences without NUC pressures. Our strategy was
to retrieve HBV sequences from GenBank deposited before 1998. The
initial search used the keywords ``hepatitis B virus'' or ``HBV''
and 1139 sequences were found. Data analyses included information
extraction: sequence quality control and amino acid substitution
analysis on 8 primary NUCr and 3 secondary substitution codons.
Three hundred and ninety-four RT-containing sequences of 8
genotypes from 25 countries in 4 continents were selected.
Twenty-seven (6.9%) sequences were found to harbor substitutions
at NUCr-related codons. Secondary substitutions (rtL80V and
rtV173G/A/L) occurred more frequently than primary NUCr
substitutions (rtI169L; rtA181G; T184A/S; rtS202T/R; rtM204L and
rtM250K). Typical amino acid substitutions associated with NUCr
were of rtL80V, rtV173L and rtT184A/S. We confirm the presence of
naturally occurring typical HBV NUCr substitutions with very low
frequencies, and secondary substitutions are more likely to occur
than primary NUCr substitutions without the selective pressure of
NUCs.},
