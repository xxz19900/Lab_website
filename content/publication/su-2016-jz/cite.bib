 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotype B2 is prevalent
in China and some other parts of Asia. This study aimed to carry
out a subgenotype B2 specific mutation analysis on important
amino acid (AA) sites in overlapping reverse transcriptase (RT)
and surface (S) protein coding regions of HBV. MATERIALS AND
METHODS: A total of 143 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive
chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with HBV subgenotype B2
infection were enrolled. HBV RT/S regions were sequenced focusing
on 43 RT resistance AA sites and 31 S AA sites with
functional/structural/conformational importance. RESULTS:
According to the consensus AA sequence for subgenotype B2, 49.7%
(71/143) of RT and 33.6% (48/143) of S protein sequences
contained detectable substitutions at 58.1% (25/43) of studied
AA sites in RT and 51.6% (16/31) of AA sites in S proteins,
respectively. The most frequently detected substitutions were
rtN134D/S (44/143, 30.8%) and sT126A/S (22/143, 15.4%), which
were located in the RT A-B interdomain region and the
corresponding antigenicity determinant region of S protein,
respectively. In addition, two patients harboring drug resistance
mutations rtL80V+rtM204I and rtL180M+rtM204V were found.
Interestingly, the patients with detectable AA substitutions at
any of the 74 sites in either/both of RT/S sequences had
significantly lower serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels than that in
patients without detectable RT/S AA substitutions (P<0.05). A
trend Chi-squared test indicated that a negative association of
serum HBsAg level with S protein sequence substitution rate was
statistically significant (P=0.047). CONCLUSION: This subgenotype
B2 specific mutation analysis revealed some naturally occurring
hot spot substitutions at important AA sites of HBV RT/S
proteins, which together might influence the serum HBV DNA and
HBsAg levels in HBeAg-positive CHB patients.},
