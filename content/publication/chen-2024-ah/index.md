abstract: 'PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate corneal limbus changes in patients
  with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) and
  explore the correlation between their ocular manifestations and systemic status.
  METHODS: Fifty-five patients with type 2 DM and 20 age-matched controls were included.
  The following IVCM parameters were compared between the 2 groups: palisades of Vogt
  (POV), corneal epithelial thickness (CET), basal cell density (BCD), subbasal nerve
  plexus, and dendritic cell density. All subjects underwent blood and urine sampling
  for laboratory analysis, including fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total
  cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,
  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, urinary albumin-to-creatinine
  ratio, urine albumin, and urine creatinine. The correlations between IVCM parameters
  and blood biomarkers were detected. Receiver operating characteristic curve was
  used for selecting the cutoff value of risk factors for corneal stem cell injury
  in patients with DM. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with DM displayed
  a significant reduction of POV (superior region, P = 0.033; inferior region, P =
  0.003; nasal region, P < 0.001; temporal region, P < 0.001), central CET (44.8 $±$
  3.6 $μ$m vs. 51.9 $±$ 3.6 $μ$m, P < 0.001), central corneal BCD (7415.5 $±$ 563.2
  cells/mm 2 vs. 9177.9 $±$ 977.8 cells/mm 2 , P < 0.001), and peripheral corneal
  BCD (6181.3 $±$ 416.5 cells/mm 2 vs. 8576.3 $±$ 933.2 cells/mm 2 , P < 0.001). Dendritic
  cell density (41.0 $±$ 33.7 cells/mm 2 vs. 24.6 $±$ 7.8 cells/mm 2 , P = 0.001)
  was significantly higher in the DM group. The following weak correlations were shown
  between IVCM parameters and blood biomarkers: central corneal BCD was negatively
  correlated with DM duration (r = -0.3, P = 0.024), TC (r = -0.36, P = 0.007), and
  LDL (r = -0.39, P = 0.004). The presence of POV in the superior region was negatively
  correlated with TC (r = -0.34, P = 0.011) and LDL (r = -0.31, P = 0.022). Cutoff
  values of 1.215 mmol/L for HDL, 1.59 mmol/L for TG, or 4.75 mmol/L for TC were established
  to distinguish patients with a high risk from a low risk for stem cell damage. CONCLUSIONS:
  Patients with type 2 DM displayed a lower positive rate of typical POV and a decrease
  in BCD, CET, and subbasal nerve density. The most relevant indicators for stem cell
  phenotypes were DM duration, TC, and LDL. Lipid status in diabetic patients could
  be a predictor of risk for developing corneal limbal stem cell deficiency. Further
  studies with larger sample sizes or basic research are needed to verify the results.'
