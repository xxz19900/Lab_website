 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical features and inflammatory
cytokines of dry eye disease (DED) in patients with
schizophrenia. METHODS: This is a case-control study. The
modified self-rating depression scale (M-SDS) and the ocular
surface disease index (OSDI) were used to evaluate the symptoms
of depression and DED, respectively. Lipid layer thickness
(LLT), partial blink rate (PBR), meibomian gland loss (MGL),
tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining,
Schirmer I-test, and eyelid margin abnormalities were also
measured. A multiplex ELISA Quantibody array was used to detect
the inflammatory cytokines in the tears of all participants.
RESULTS: Forty schizophrenic patients and 20 control subjects
were included. The mean age was 45.0 $±$ 9.5 years (range,
22-63 years) in schizophrenic patients and 45.4 $±$ 16.2 years
(range, 23-76 years) in controls (P = 0.914). The ratio of male
to female was 1.1 in schizophrenic patients and 1.0 in controls
(P = 0.914). Ten women (52.6%) with schizophrenia and 2 (20%)
in the control group (P = 0.096) were menopausal or
post-menopausal. The OSDI [0.0 (0.0-4.2) vs. 7.3 (2.1-14.6)] and
TBUT [4.5 (3.0-6.0) vs. 10.0 (3.5-11.0)] were significantly
lower in patients with schizophrenia than in controls (P = 0.003
and P = 0.009, respectively). The rate of MGL [36.5 (17.5-47.5)
vs. 8.5 (0.0-17.5)] increased in schizophrenic patients (P <
0.001). Among pro-inflammatory cytokines, the levels of
interleukin (IL)-1$α$, IL-6, IL-11, IL-12A, IL-15, IL-17A,
and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in tears were
elevated in the schizophrenia group (all P < 0.01). Most of the
chemokines examined were at increased levels in the tears of
schizophrenics (all P < 0.05). The levels of matrix
metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) and intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were also higher in the schizophrenic
patients (all P < 0.001). The concentrations of IL-1Ra,
tissue-inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and TIMP-2 in
the schizophrenia group were decreased (all P < 0.001). In
schizophrenic patients, the level of CCL2 in tears was
positively correlated with OSDI (R = 0.34, P = 0.03). The
increasing TIMP-1 and decreasing IL-5 were correlated with
increasing LLT (R = 0.33, P = 0.035; R = -0.35, P = 0.027,
respectively). The level of ICAM-1 was then positively
correlated with partial blink rate (PBR) (R = 0.33, P = 0.035).
There was a negative correlation between IL-8 and the Schirmer
I-test (R = -0.41, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
schizophrenia were more likely to experience asymptomatic DED,
with mild symptoms and obvious signs. The inflammatory cytokines
in the tears of schizophrenic patients differed greatly from
that of non-schizophrenic patients.},
