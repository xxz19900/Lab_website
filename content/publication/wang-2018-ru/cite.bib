 abstract = {Microbiome research is a quickly developing field in biomedical
research, and we have witnessed its potential in understanding
the physiology, metabolism and immunology, its critical role in
understanding the health and disease of the host, and its vast
capacity in disease prediction, intervention and treatment.
However, many of the fundamental questions still need to be
addressed, including the shaping forces of microbial diversity
between individuals and across time. Microbiome research falls
into the classical nature vs. nurture scenario, such that host
genetics shape part of the microbiome, while environmental
influences change the original course of microbiome development.
In this review, we focus on the nature, i.e., the genetic part of
the equation, and summarize the recent efforts in understanding
which parts of the genome, especially the human and mouse genome,
play important roles in determining the composition and functions
of microbial communities, primarily in the gut but also on the
skin. We aim to present an overview of different approaches in
studying the intricate relationships between host genetic
variations and microbes, its underlying philosophy and
methodology, and we aim to highlight a few key discoveries along
this exploration, as well as current pitfalls. More evidence and
results will surely appear in upcoming studies, and the
accumulating knowledge will lead to a deeper understanding of
what we could finally term a ``hologenome'', that is, the
organized, closely interacting genome of the host and the
microbiome.},
