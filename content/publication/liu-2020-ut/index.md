abstract: N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal mRNA modification,
  and N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), found at the first-transcribed nucleotide,
  are two reversible epitranscriptomic marks. However, the profiles and distribution
  patterns of m6A and m6Am across human and mouse tissues are poorly characterized.
  Here, we report the m6A and m6Am methylome through profiling of 43 human and 16
  mouse tissues and demonstrate strongest tissue specificity for the brain tissues.
  A small subset of tissue-specific m6A peaks can also readily classify tissue types.
  The overall m6A and m6Am level is partially correlated with the expression level
  of their writers and erasers. Additionally, the m6A-containing regions are enriched
  for SNPs. Furthermore, cross-species analysis revealed that species rather than
  tissue type is the primary determinant of methylation. Collectively, our study provides
  an in-depth resource for dissecting the landscape and regulation of the m6A and
  m6Am epitranscriptomic marks across mammalian tissues.
