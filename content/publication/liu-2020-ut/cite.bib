 abstract = {N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal mRNA
modification, and N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), found at the
first-transcribed nucleotide, are two reversible
epitranscriptomic marks. However, the profiles and distribution
patterns of m6A and m6Am across human and mouse tissues are
poorly characterized. Here, we report the m6A and m6Am methylome
through profiling of 43 human and 16 mouse tissues and
demonstrate strongest tissue specificity for the brain tissues.
A small subset of tissue-specific m6A peaks can also readily
classify tissue types. The overall m6A and m6Am level is
partially correlated with the expression level of their writers
and erasers. Additionally, the m6A-containing regions are
enriched for SNPs. Furthermore, cross-species analysis revealed
that species rather than tissue type is the primary determinant
of methylation. Collectively, our study provides an in-depth
resource for dissecting the landscape and regulation of the m6A
and m6Am epitranscriptomic marks across mammalian tissues.},
