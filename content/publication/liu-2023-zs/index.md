abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To analyze the epidemiologic features, culture positivity,
  the fungal spectrum of different sites of ocular infection in North China over 20
  years from 2001 to 2020. METHODS: 11, 635 patients suspected of ocular fungal infection
  were reviewed. The demographic profile, fungal positive culture rate among different
  sites, the distribution, and trends of main pathogens among cornea and intraocular
  fluid were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 11, 635 samples, the positive culture rate of
  ocular fungal infection was 23.6%. Most of samples (83.1%) were from cornea, and
  their culture positivity was 26.9%. Fungal keratitis occurred more often during
  the harvesting season (October to December; 34.0%) than in other seasons (average:
  22.0%). Fusarium sp. (53.2%), Aspergillus sp. (15.9%) and Alternaria sp. (12.5%)
  were the most common fungal species of ocular mycotic infections in the past two
  decades in north China. 2562 organisms were identified from cornea, of which 1443
  (56.3%) were Fusarium sp., 403 (15.7%) and 329 (12.8%) were Aspergillus sp., and
  Alternaria sp., respectively. Of the 120 fungi isolated from the intraocular fluid,
  the most common was Aspergillus sp. (33.3%), followed by Fusarium sp. (24.2%) and
  Candida sp. (15.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Fusarium sp., Aspergillus sp. and Alternaria sp.
  were the most common organisms in cases of fungal keratitis, while Aspergillus sp.,
  Fusarium sp. and Candida sp. were the most frequent isolates for fungal endophthalmitis.'
