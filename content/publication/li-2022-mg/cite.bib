 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Functional constipation is a gastrointestinal
disorder that affects millions of people and is correlated with
gut microbiome dysbiosis. The currently available treatments are
ineffective; therefore, novel treatment schemes targeting the
gut microbiome are desired. The aim of this study was to assess
the effects of yogurt supplemented with seven probiotic strains
and six types of dietary fibers on functional constipation.
METHODS: In the mouse study, mice with induced constipation were
administered the yogurt once a day for 1 wk, with fecal
parameters and intestinal transit rate measured. In the clinical
study, participants with constipation (N = 86) were given the
yogurt once daily (200 g) for 4 wk. Fecal and blood samples
along with Patient Assessment of Constipation-symptoms and
Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life Scale
questionnaires were collected to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of the yogurt. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was
performed to analyze fecal samples of both mice and humans.
RESULTS: We found that constipated mice had different gut
microbiomes compared with those in healthy controls; yogurt
treatment significantly relieved constipation-related symptoms
and resulted in shifts in the microbiome. Yogurt also relieved
symptoms of antibiotic-induced constipation in mice and restored
the gut microbiome to a certain extent. In the clinical trial
with 86 patients, yogurt administration significantly improved
constipation symptoms and showed no serious adverse effects (was
generally considered safe). However, subsequent metagenomic
profiling of the gut microbiome did not reveal significant
changes in the microbial composition, in contrast to the results
in mice. We hypothesize that the differences in dosage between
mice and humans may attribute to such discrepancies, and
microbiome changes may not be necessary for improvements of
constipation symptoms in humans. CONCLUSION: Results from this
study showed that yogurt can potentially be used for the
treatment of constipation.},
