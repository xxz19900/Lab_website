abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Functional constipation is a gastrointestinal disorder that
  affects millions of people and is correlated with gut microbiome dysbiosis. The
  currently available treatments are ineffective; therefore, novel treatment schemes
  targeting the gut microbiome are desired. The aim of this study was to assess the
  effects of yogurt supplemented with seven probiotic strains and six types of dietary
  fibers on functional constipation. METHODS: In the mouse study, mice with induced
  constipation were administered the yogurt once a day for 1 wk, with fecal parameters
  and intestinal transit rate measured. In the clinical study, participants with constipation
  (N = 86) were given the yogurt once daily (200 g) for 4 wk. Fecal and blood samples
  along with Patient Assessment of Constipation-symptoms and Patient Assessment of
  Constipation-Quality of Life Scale questionnaires were collected to evaluate the
  safety and efficacy of the yogurt. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed
  to analyze fecal samples of both mice and humans. RESULTS: We found that constipated
  mice had different gut microbiomes compared with those in healthy controls; yogurt
  treatment significantly relieved constipation-related symptoms and resulted in shifts
  in the microbiome. Yogurt also relieved symptoms of antibiotic-induced constipation
  in mice and restored the gut microbiome to a certain extent. In the clinical trial
  with 86 patients, yogurt administration significantly improved constipation symptoms
  and showed no serious adverse effects (was generally considered safe). However,
  subsequent metagenomic profiling of the gut microbiome did not reveal significant
  changes in the microbial composition, in contrast to the results in mice. We hypothesize
  that the differences in dosage between mice and humans may attribute to such discrepancies,
  and microbiome changes may not be necessary for improvements of constipation symptoms
  in humans. CONCLUSION: Results from this study showed that yogurt can potentially
  be used for the treatment of constipation.'
