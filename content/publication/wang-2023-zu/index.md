abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of human umbilical
  cord-derived MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (hucMSC-EVs) in a mouse model of
  desiccation-induced dry eye disease (DED). METHODS: hucMSC-EVs were enriched by
  ultracentrifugation. The DED model was induced by desiccating environment combined
  with scopolamine administration. The DED mice were divided into the hucMSC-EVs group,
  fluorometholone (FML) group, PBS group, and blank control group. Tear secretion,
  corneal fluorescein staining, the cytokine profiles in tears and goblet cells, TUNEL-positive
  cell, and CD4+ cells were examined to assess therapeutic efficiency. The miRNAs
  in the hucMSC-EVs were sequenced, and the top 10 were used for miRNA enrichment
  analysis and annotation. The targeted DED-related signaling pathway was further
  verified by using RT-qPCR and western blotting. RESULTS: Treatment with hucMSC-EVs
  increased the tear volume and maintained corneal integrity in DED mice. The cytokine
  profile in the tears of the hucMSC-EVs group presented with a lower level of proinflammatory
  cytokines than PBS group. Moreover, hucMSC-EVs treatment increased goblet cell density
  and inhibited cell apoptosis and CD4+ cell infiltration. Functional analysis of
  the top 10 miRNAs in hucMSC-EVs showed a high correlation with immunity. Among them,
  miR-125 b, let-7b, and miR-6873 were conserved between humans and mice and were
  associated with the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-$ąppa$B pathway that was activated in DED. Furthermore,
  IRAK1/TAB2/NF-$p̨pa$B pathway activation and the abnormal expression of IL-4, IL-8,
  IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, and TNF-$α$ were reversed by hucMSC-EVs. CONCLUSIONS: hucMSCs-EVs
  alleviate DED signs, suppress inflammation and restore homeostasis of the corneal
  surface by multitargeting the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-$kp̨a$B pathway via certain miRNAs.'
