 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of human
umbilical cord-derived MSC-derived extracellular vesicles
(hucMSC-EVs) in a mouse model of desiccation-induced dry eye
disease (DED). METHODS: hucMSC-EVs were enriched by
ultracentrifugation. The DED model was induced by desiccating
environment combined with scopolamine administration. The DED
mice were divided into the hucMSC-EVs group, fluorometholone
(FML) group, PBS group, and blank control group. Tear secretion,
corneal fluorescein staining, the cytokine profiles in tears and
goblet cells, TUNEL-positive cell, and CD4+ cells were examined
to assess therapeutic efficiency. The miRNAs in the hucMSC-EVs
were sequenced, and the top 10 were used for miRNA enrichment
analysis and annotation. The targeted DED-related signaling
pathway was further verified by using RT-qPCR and western
blotting. RESULTS: Treatment with hucMSC-EVs increased the tear
volume and maintained corneal integrity in DED mice. The
cytokine profile in the tears of the hucMSC-EVs group presented
with a lower level of proinflammatory cytokines than PBS group.
Moreover, hucMSC-EVs treatment increased goblet cell density and
inhibited cell apoptosis and CD4+ cell infiltration. Functional
analysis of the top 10 miRNAs in hucMSC-EVs showed a high
correlation with immunity. Among them, miR-125 b, let-7b, and
miR-6873 were conserved between humans and mice and were
associated with the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-$ąppa$B pathway that was
activated in DED. Furthermore, IRAK1/TAB2/NF-$\p̨pa$B pathway
activation and the abnormal expression of IL-4, IL-8, IL-10,
IL-13, IL-17, and TNF-$α$ were reversed by hucMSC-EVs.
CONCLUSIONS: hucMSCs-EVs alleviate DED signs, suppress
inflammation and restore homeostasis of the corneal surface by
multitargeting the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-$\kp̨a$B pathway via certain
miRNAs.},
