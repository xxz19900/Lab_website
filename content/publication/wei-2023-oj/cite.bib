 abstract = {Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is a blinding corneal infection
caused by the protozoan Acanthamoeba. The long-term course of AK
suggests the host immunity could not kill Acanthamoeba rapidly.
The immune status is still unclear in the late stage of AK. The
comparative transcriptome analysis was made based on the bulk RNA
sequencing of cornea tissues from AK patients and donors.
Differentially expressed genes and enriched signaling pathways
were calculated. CIBERSORT algorithm was used for immune
infiltration analysis of cornea tissue between AK and normal
controls. A total of 2668 differentially expressed genes,
including 1477 upregulated genes and 1191 downregulated genes,
were detected. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the pathways
were significantly enriched in leukocyte migration, regulation of
T-cell activation, the external side of plasma membrane,
collagen-containing extracellular matrix, immune receptor
activity, and cytokine binding. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes pathway analysis showed that the pathways were
significantly enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor
interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage, and Staphylococcus
aureus infection pathway. The immune infiltration profiles varied
little between AK and normal controls. Compared with normal
tissue, cornea tissue of AK contained a higher proportion of M0
macrophages and CD8 T cells, while resting memory CD4 T cells
contributed to a relatively lower portion (p < 0.05). Finally,
the expression levels of cell markers and SLAMF7/STAT6 pathway
were confirmed by histopathology examinations, RT-qPCR, and
Western blot.},
