abstract: Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is a blinding corneal infection caused by the
  protozoan Acanthamoeba. The long-term course of AK suggests the host immunity could
  not kill Acanthamoeba rapidly. The immune status is still unclear in the late stage
  of AK. The comparative transcriptome analysis was made based on the bulk RNA sequencing
  of cornea tissues from AK patients and donors. Differentially expressed genes and
  enriched signaling pathways were calculated. CIBERSORT algorithm was used for immune
  infiltration analysis of cornea tissue between AK and normal controls. A total of
  2668 differentially expressed genes, including 1477 upregulated genes and 1191 downregulated
  genes, were detected. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the pathways were significantly
  enriched in leukocyte migration, regulation of T-cell activation, the external side
  of plasma membrane, collagen-containing extracellular matrix, immune receptor activity,
  and cytokine binding. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis
  showed that the pathways were significantly enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor
  interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage, and Staphylococcus aureus infection pathway.
  The immune infiltration profiles varied little between AK and normal controls. Compared
  with normal tissue, cornea tissue of AK contained a higher proportion of M0 macrophages
  and CD8 T cells, while resting memory CD4 T cells contributed to a relatively lower
  portion (p < 0.05). Finally, the expression levels of cell markers and SLAMF7/STAT6
  pathway were confirmed by histopathology examinations, RT-qPCR, and Western blot.
