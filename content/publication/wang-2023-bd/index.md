abstract: 'Purpose: The limbal niche supports the self-renewal of limbal epithelial
  stem cells (LESCs). The corneal stromal stem cell (CSSC) is an important component
  in the niche that regulates the LESC phenotype. However, the intercellular communication
  between LESCs and CSSCs has yet to be elucidated. Methods: A traditional two-dimensional
  (2D) system, a direct three-dimensional (3D) system, and an indirect 3D coculture
  system of LESCs and CSSCs were used to elucidate the paracrine pathway effect of
  CSSCs on LESCs. To reveal the impact of CSSC derived extracellular vesicles (CSSC-EVs)
  on LESCs, GW4869 and CSSC-EVs were added separately to the LESC culture medium.
  The outgrowth rate, cell density, differentiation, and stemness maintenance were
  compared among these methods. The miRNAs in the CSSC-EVs were sequenced, and the
  targeted Notch pathway was further confirmed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Results:
  Compared with 2D culture, both the direct and indirect 3D coculture systems yielded
  a higher outgrowth rate and expression of stem cell markers of LESCs. The phenotypes
  of LESCs cultivated using the two coculture approaches were also comparable. Nevertheless,
  GW4869 inhibited the effect of CSSCs on LESCs, and the addition of CSSC-EVs to the
  2D culture system could increase cell density, and the proportion of p63$Î±$bright
  cells, which indicated that CSSC-EVs were crucial in regulating LESCs. Furthermore,
  the EV-AlixKD with reduced miRNA partly lost its regulating function. The abundant
  miRNAs in CSSC-EVs, such as hsa-miR-663b, hsa-miR-16-5p, and hsa-miR-1290, target
  the Notch pathway. The LESCs transfected with miR-663b had higher p63 expression
  via downregulating of the Notch pathway. Conclusions: CSSC-EV played an important
  role in promoting LESC proliferation and stemness maintenance by targeting Notch
  signaling via miRNAs, which will increase our understanding of the limbal niche
  and provide a potential new approach for LESC culture and the treatment of corneal
  epithelial disorders.'
