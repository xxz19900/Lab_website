               (TCM) formula, has long been used for the treatment of common
               metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. However,
               the main limitation of its wider application is ingredient
               complexity of this formula. Thus, it is critically important to
               identify the major active ingredients of GQD and to illustrate
               mechanisms underlying its action. Here, we compared the effects
               of GQD and berberine, a hypothetical key active pharmaceutical
               ingredient of GQD, on a diabetic rat model by comprehensive
               analyses of gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids,
               proinflammatory cytokines, and ileum transcriptomics. Our
               results show that berberine and GQD had similar effects on
               lowering blood glucose levels, modulating gut microbiota,
               inducing ileal gene expression, as well as relieving systemic
               and local inflammation. As expected, both berberine and GQD
               treatment significantly altered the overall gut microbiota
               structure and enriched many butyrate-producing bacteria,
               including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, thereby attenuating
               intestinal inflammation and lowering glucose. Levels of
               short-chain fatty acids in rat feces were also significantly
               elevated after treatment with berberine or GQD. Moreover,
               concentration of serum proinflammatory cytokines and expression
               of immune-related genes, including Nfkb1, Stat1, and Ifnrg1, in
               pancreatic islets were significantly reduced after treatment.
               Our study demonstrates that the main effects of GQD can be
               attributed to berberine via modulating gut microbiota. The
               strategy employed would facilitate further standardization and
               widespread application of TCM in many diseases.",

              with high morbidity. Host immune responses function as a
              double-edged sword by eradicating fungal pathogens while also
              causing corneal damage, dictating the severity, progression, and
              outcome of FK. However, the underlying immunopathogenesis remains
              elusive. Methods: Time-course transcriptome was performed to
              illustrate the dynamic immune landscape in a mouse model of FK.
              Integrated bioinformatic analyses included identification of
              differentially expressed genes, time series clustering, Gene
              Ontology enrichment, and inference of infiltrating immune cells.
              Gene expression was verified by quantitative polymerase chain
              reaction (qPCR), Western blot, or immunohistochemistry. Results:
              FK mice exhibited dynamic immune responses with concerted trends
              with clinical score, transcriptional alteration, and immune cell
              infiltration score peaking at 3 days post infection (dpi).
              Disrupted substrate metabolism, broad immune activation, and
              corneal wound healing occurred sequentially in early, middle, and
              late stages of FK. Meanwhile, dynamics of infiltrating innate and
              adaptive immune cells displayed distinct characteristics.
              Proportions of dendritic cells showed overall decreasing trend
              with fungal infection, whereas that of macrophages, monocytes,
              and neutrophils rose sharply in early stage and then gradually
              decreased as inflammation resolved. Activation of adaptive immune
              cells was also observed in late stage of infection. Furthermore,
              shared immune responses and activation of AIM2-, pyrin-, and
              ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis were revealed across different time
              points. Conclusions: Our study profiles the dynamic immune
              landscape and highlights the crucial roles of PANoptosis in FK
              pathogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into host

              microbiological profile, treatment, and prognosis of corneal
              infections after different keratorefractive surgery. METHODS: To
              obtain relevant studies, English-language databases, including
              PubMed, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, and CLNAHL, were searched
              from January 1979 to March 2022. The fundamentals of the
              literature, clinical characteristics, pathogens, and treatments
              were retrieved for each included article. RESULTS: Eighty-four
              studies involving 306 infectious eyes were included in this
              review. Risk factors of potential infection included a history of
              blepharitis, contact lens usage, and contaminated surgical
              instruments. The mean onset time was 22.9$\pm$38.7 days (range: 1
              day to 3 years). The most common organism isolated from
              infectious keratitis after keratorefractive surgery were
              Staphylococcus aureus , followed by Mycobacterium and
              coagulase-negative Staphylococcus . Most of the infections after
              refractive procedures were sensitive to medical treatment alone,
              and the ultimate best-corrected visual acuity after medical
              treatment was as follows: 20/20 or better in 82 cases (37.0\%),
              20/40 or better in 170 cases (76.5\%), and worse than 20/40 in 52
              cases (23.5\%). Surgical interventions including flap lift, flap
              amputation, ring removal, and keratoplasty were performed in 120
              eyes (44.5\%). CONCLUSIONS: Most infections after
              keratorefractive surgery occur within a week, whereas more than
              half of the cases after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis
              happen after about a month. Gram-positive cocci and mycobacterium
              are the most common isolates. Infections after LASIK,
              intracorneal ring (ICR) implantation, and small incision
              lenticule extraction, which primarily occur between the cornea

               ultracentrifugation. The DED model was induced by desiccating
               environment combined with scopolamine administration. The DED
               mice were divided into the hucMSC-EVs group, fluorometholone
               (FML) group, PBS group, and blank control group. Tear secretion,
               corneal fluorescein staining, the cytokine profiles in tears and
               goblet cells, TUNEL-positive cell, and CD4+ cells were examined
               to assess therapeutic efficiency. The miRNAs in the hucMSC-EVs
               were sequenced, and the top 10 were used for miRNA enrichment
               analysis and annotation. The targeted DED-related signaling
               pathway was further verified by using RT-qPCR and western
               blotting. RESULTS: Treatment with hucMSC-EVs increased the tear
               volume and maintained corneal integrity in DED mice. The
               cytokine profile in the tears of the hucMSC-EVs group presented
               with a lower level of proinflammatory cytokines than PBS group.
               Moreover, hucMSC-EVs treatment increased goblet cell density and
               inhibited cell apoptosis and CD4+ cell infiltration. Functional
               analysis of the top 10 miRNAs in hucMSC-EVs showed a high
               correlation with immunity. Among them, miR-125 b, let-7b, and
               miR-6873 were conserved between humans and mice and were
               associated with the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-$\kappa$B pathway that was

               IL-13, IL-17, and TNF-$\alpha$ were reversed by hucMSC-EVs.

               inflammation and restore homeostasis of the corneal surface by

              epithelial stem cells (LESCs). The corneal stromal stem cell
              (CSSC) is an important component in the niche that regulates the
              LESC phenotype. However, the intercellular communication between
              LESCs and CSSCs has yet to be elucidated. Methods: A traditional
              two-dimensional (2D) system, a direct three-dimensional (3D)
              system, and an indirect 3D coculture system of LESCs and CSSCs
              were used to elucidate the paracrine pathway effect of CSSCs on
              LESCs. To reveal the impact of CSSC derived extracellular
              vesicles (CSSC-EVs) on LESCs, GW4869 and CSSC-EVs were added
              separately to the LESC culture medium. The outgrowth rate, cell
              density, differentiation, and stemness maintenance were compared
              among these methods. The miRNAs in the CSSC-EVs were sequenced,
              and the targeted Notch pathway was further confirmed by RT-qPCR
              and Western blotting. Results: Compared with 2D culture, both the
              direct and indirect 3D coculture systems yielded a higher
              outgrowth rate and expression of stem cell markers of LESCs. The
              phenotypes of LESCs cultivated using the two coculture approaches
              were also comparable. Nevertheless, GW4869 inhibited the effect
              of CSSCs on LESCs, and the addition of CSSC-EVs to the 2D culture
              system could increase cell density, and the proportion of
              p63$\alpha$bright cells, which indicated that CSSC-EVs were
              crucial in regulating LESCs. Furthermore, the EV-AlixKD with
              reduced miRNA partly lost its regulating function. The abundant
              miRNAs in CSSC-EVs, such as hsa-miR-663b, hsa-miR-16-5p, and
              hsa-miR-1290, target the Notch pathway. The LESCs transfected
              with miR-663b had higher p63 expression via downregulating of the

              promoting LESC proliferation and stemness maintenance by
              targeting Notch signaling via miRNAs, which will increase our

              $\pm$ 977.8 cells/mm 2 , P < 0.001), and peripheral corneal BCD
              (6181.3 $\pm$ 416.5 cells/mm 2 vs. 8576.3 $\pm$ 933.2 cells/mm 2
              , P < 0.001). Dendritic cell density (41.0 $\pm$ 33.7 cells/mm 2
              vs. 24.6 $\pm$ 7.8 cells/mm 2 , P = 0.001) was significantly
              higher in the DM group. The following weak correlations were
              shown between IVCM parameters and blood biomarkers: central
              corneal BCD was negatively correlated with DM duration (r = -0.3,
              P = 0.024), TC (r = -0.36, P = 0.007), and LDL (r = -0.39, P =
              0.004). The presence of POV in the superior region was negatively
              correlated with TC (r = -0.34, P = 0.011) and LDL (r = -0.31, P =
              0.022). Cutoff values of 1.215 mmol/L for HDL, 1.59 mmol/L for
              TG, or 4.75 mmol/L for TC were established to distinguish
              patients with a high risk from a low risk for stem cell damage.
              CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 DM displayed a lower positive
              rate of typical POV and a decrease in BCD, CET, and subbasal
              nerve density. The most relevant indicators for stem cell
              phenotypes were DM duration, TC, and LDL. Lipid status in
              diabetic patients could be a predictor of risk for developing
              corneal limbal stem cell deficiency. Further studies with larger
              sample sizes or basic research are needed to verify the results.",

               positivity, the fungal spectrum of different sites of ocular
               infection in North China over 20 years from 2001 to 2020.
               METHODS: 11, 635 patients suspected of ocular fungal infection
               were reviewed. The demographic profile, fungal positive culture
               rate among different sites, the distribution, and trends of main
               pathogens among cornea and intraocular fluid were analyzed.
               RESULTS: Among 11, 635 samples, the positive culture rate of
               ocular fungal infection was 23.6\%. Most of samples (83.1\%)
               were from cornea, and their culture positivity was 26.9\%.
               Fungal keratitis occurred more often during the harvesting
               season (October to December; 34.0\%) than in other seasons
               (average: 22.0\%). Fusarium sp. (53.2\%), Aspergillus sp.
               (15.9\%) and Alternaria sp. (12.5\%) were the most common fungal
               species of ocular mycotic infections in the past two decades in

               keratitis. The spectrum of pathogenic bacteria and their
               susceptibility to antibiotics varied with the different regions.
               A meta-analysis was conducted to review the global culture rate,
               distribution, current trends, and drug susceptibility of
               isolates from BK over the past 20 years (2000-2020). Four
               databases were searched, and published date was limited between
               2000 and 2020. Main key words were ``bacterial keratitis'',
               ``culture results'' and ``drug resistance''. Forty-two studies
               from twenty-one countries (35 cities) were included for
               meta-analysis. The overall positive culture rate was 47\%
               (95\%CI, 42-52\%). Gram-positive cocci were the major type of
               bacteria (62\%), followed by Gram-negative bacilli (30\%),
               Gram-positive bacilli (5\%), and Gram-negative cocci (5\%).
               Staphylococcus spp. (41.4\%), Pseudomonas spp. (17.0\%),
               Streptococcus spp. (13.1\%), Corynebacterium spp. (6.6\%) and
               Moraxella spp. (4.1\%) were the most common bacterial organism.
               The antibiotic resistance pattern analysis revealed that most
               Gram-positive cocci were susceptive to aminoglycoside (86\%),
               followed by fluoroquinolone (81\%) and cephalosporin (79\%).

               fluoroquinolones were decreasing since 2010. Clinics should pay
               attention to the changing trends of pathogen distribution and

               modified self-rating depression scale (M-SDS) and the ocular
               surface disease index (OSDI) were used to evaluate the symptoms
               of depression and DED, respectively. Lipid layer thickness
               (LLT), partial blink rate (PBR), meibomian gland loss (MGL),
               tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining,
               Schirmer I-test, and eyelid margin abnormalities were also
               measured. A multiplex ELISA Quantibody array was used to detect
               the inflammatory cytokines in the tears of all participants.
               RESULTS: Forty schizophrenic patients and 20 control subjects
               were included. The mean age was 45.0 $\pm$ 9.5 years (range,
               22-63 years) in schizophrenic patients and 45.4 $\pm$ 16.2 years
               (range, 23-76 years) in controls (P = 0.914). The ratio of male
               to female was 1.1 in schizophrenic patients and 1.0 in controls
               (P = 0.914). Ten women (52.6\%) with schizophrenia and 2 (20\%)
               in the control group (P = 0.096) were menopausal or
               post-menopausal. The OSDI [0.0 (0.0-4.2) vs. 7.3 (2.1-14.6)] and
               TBUT [4.5 (3.0-6.0) vs. 10.0 (3.5-11.0)] were significantly
               lower in patients with schizophrenia than in controls (P = 0.003
               and P = 0.009, respectively). The rate of MGL [36.5 (17.5-47.5)
               vs. 8.5 (0.0-17.5)] increased in schizophrenic patients (P <
               0.001). Among pro-inflammatory cytokines, the levels of
               interleukin (IL)-1$\alpha$, IL-6, IL-11, IL-12A, IL-15, IL-17A,
               and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in tears were
               elevated in the schizophrenia group (all P < 0.01). Most of the
               chemokines examined were at increased levels in the tears of
               schizophrenics (all P < 0.05). The levels of matrix
               metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) and intercellular adhesion
               molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were also higher in the schizophrenic
               patients (all P < 0.001). The concentrations of IL-1Ra,
               tissue-inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and TIMP-2 in
               the schizophrenia group were decreased (all P < 0.001). In
               schizophrenic patients, the level of CCL2 in tears was
               positively correlated with OSDI (R = 0.34, P = 0.03). The
               increasing TIMP-1 and decreasing IL-5 were correlated with
               increasing LLT (R = 0.33, P = 0.035; R = -0.35, P = 0.027,
               respectively). The level of ICAM-1 was then positively
               correlated with partial blink rate (PBR) (R = 0.33, P = 0.035).
               There was a negative correlation between IL-8 and the Schirmer
               I-test (R = -0.41, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
               schizophrenia were more likely to experience asymptomatic DED,
               with mild symptoms and obvious signs. The inflammatory cytokines

              The immune status is still unclear in the late stage of AK. The
              comparative transcriptome analysis was made based on the bulk RNA
              sequencing of cornea tissues from AK patients and donors.
              Differentially expressed genes and enriched signaling pathways

              infiltration analysis of cornea tissue between AK and normal

              including 1477 upregulated genes and 1191 downregulated genes,

               disorder that affects millions of people and is correlated with
               gut microbiome dysbiosis. The currently available treatments are
               ineffective; therefore, novel treatment schemes targeting the
               gut microbiome are desired. The aim of this study was to assess
               the effects of yogurt supplemented with seven probiotic strains
               and six types of dietary fibers on functional constipation.
               METHODS: In the mouse study, mice with induced constipation were
               administered the yogurt once a day for 1 wk, with fecal
               parameters and intestinal transit rate measured. In the clinical
               study, participants with constipation (N = 86) were given the
               yogurt once daily (200 g) for 4 wk. Fecal and blood samples
               along with Patient Assessment of Constipation-symptoms and
               Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life Scale
               questionnaires were collected to evaluate the safety and
               efficacy of the yogurt. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was
               performed to analyze fecal samples of both mice and humans.
               RESULTS: We found that constipated mice had different gut
               microbiomes compared with those in healthy controls; yogurt
               treatment significantly relieved constipation-related symptoms
               and resulted in shifts in the microbiome. Yogurt also relieved
               symptoms of antibiotic-induced constipation in mice and restored
               the gut microbiome to a certain extent. In the clinical trial
               with 86 patients, yogurt administration significantly improved
               constipation symptoms and showed no serious adverse effects (was
               generally considered safe). However, subsequent metagenomic
               profiling of the gut microbiome did not reveal significant
               changes in the microbial composition, in contrast to the results
               in mice. We hypothesize that the differences in dosage between
               mice and humans may attribute to such discrepancies, and
               microbiome changes may not be necessary for improvements of
               constipation symptoms in humans. CONCLUSION: Results from this
               study showed that yogurt can potentially be used for the
               treatment of constipation.",

              meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) with or without ocular surface
              inflammation (OSI). METHODS: We performed a case-control study on
              patients with diagnosed obstructive MGD between August 2017 and
              November 2019. RESULTS: 30 MGD cases and 25 healthy controls were
              recruited. The classification of MGD patients with and without
              OSI was based on the tear pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.
              Compared with the MGD without OSI and the control group, a higher
              CEDC density was detected in the MGD with OSI subgroup. The
              presence of >15.6 cells/mm2 CEDC had a sensitivity of 73\% and
              specificity of 75\% for the diagnosis of MGD with OSI.
              CONCLUSIONS: OSI is not present in all patients with obstructive
              MGD. Evaluation of CEDC density in the central cornea may help
              identify whether MGD is concomitant with OSI.",

              (RT) region of HBV could confer resistance to

              to identify new RT amino acid (AA) substitutions related to NUC
              resistance. METHODS: HBV RT sequences of genotype C from 501
              chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients were analysed to identify
              potential RT substitutions related to NUC resistance. In vitro
              studies without and with NUCs were performed in a HepG2 cell line
              transfected by clones with RT harbouring wild-type or substituted
              AA(s) of interest. RESULTS: Among 261 NUC-treated CHB patients,
              we found a high detection rate of rtM204I/V substitution (30.7\%
              [80/261]). We identified a new substitution of rtH55R, and its
              detection rate had a significantly increasing trend from 3.8\%
              (9/240) in the untreated group to 7.2\% (13/181) or 33.8\%
              (27/80) in the treated group with rtM204 or with rtM204I/V
              substitutions (P<0.0001). In vitro studies showed that rtH55R had
              a similar HBV DNA level compared to wild type. The rtH55R+rtM204I
              clone had a significantly better replication capacity than the
              rtM204I clone without NUCs (P<0.05). The replication capacity of
              the rtM204I clone was found to significantly decrease under
              lamivudine treatment, but this was not found in the
              rtH55R+rtM204I clone. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a new HBV RT
              substitution of rtH55R in genotype-C-infected CHB patients. It is
              frequently found in combination with rtM204I/V substitution under
              NUC treatment. In vitro studies suggest that it might play some
              replication compensatory role in rtM204I mutants under lamivudine
              treatment.",

              clinical approval of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs; year of

              sequences obtained before 1998 and better understand the
              evolution of RT sequences without NUC pressures. Our strategy was
              to retrieve HBV sequences from GenBank deposited before 1998. The
              initial search used the keywords ``hepatitis B virus'' or ``HBV''
              and 1139 sequences were found. Data analyses included information
              extraction: sequence quality control and amino acid substitution
              analysis on 8 primary NUCr and 3 secondary substitution codons.
              Three hundred and ninety-four RT-containing sequences of 8
              genotypes from 25 countries in 4 continents were selected.
              Twenty-seven (6.9\%) sequences were found to harbor substitutions
              at NUCr-related codons. Secondary substitutions (rtL80V and
              rtV173G/A/L) occurred more frequently than primary NUCr

              were of rtL80V, rtV173L and rtT184A/S. We confirm the presence of
              naturally occurring typical HBV NUCr substitutions with very low
              frequencies, and secondary substitutions are more likely to occur
              than primary NUCr substitutions without the selective pressure of

              and surface (S) protein coding regions of HBV. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: A total of 143 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive
              chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with HBV subgenotype B2
              infection were enrolled. HBV RT/S regions were sequenced focusing
              on 43 RT resistance AA sites and 31 S AA sites with
              functional/structural/conformational importance. RESULTS:
              According to the consensus AA sequence for subgenotype B2, 49.7\%
              (71/143) of RT and 33.6\% (48/143) of S protein sequences
              contained detectable substitutions at 58.1\% (25/43) of studied
              AA sites in RT and 51.6\% (16/31) of AA sites in S proteins,
              respectively. The most frequently detected substitutions were
              rtN134D/S (44/143, 30.8\%) and sT126A/S (22/143, 15.4\%), which
              were located in the RT A-B interdomain region and the
              corresponding antigenicity determinant region of S protein,
              respectively. In addition, two patients harboring drug resistance
              mutations rtL80V+rtM204I and rtL180M+rtM204V were found.
              Interestingly, the patients with detectable AA substitutions at
              any of the 74 sites in either/both of RT/S sequences had
              significantly lower serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels than that in
              patients without detectable RT/S AA substitutions (P<0.05). A
              trend Chi-squared test indicated that a negative association of
              serum HBsAg level with S protein sequence substitution rate was
              statistically significant (P=0.047). CONCLUSION: This subgenotype
              B2 specific mutation analysis revealed some naturally occurring
              hot spot substitutions at important AA sites of HBV RT/S
              proteins, which together might influence the serum HBV DNA and
